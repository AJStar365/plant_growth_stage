File: train_model.py
Changes:
- Replaced MobileNetV2 with InceptionV3 as the base model for transfer learning.
- Adjusted the fine-tuning strategy to be more cautious for a smaller dataset. After initial training of the classifier head, the top two Inception blocks (from layer 249 onwards) are unfrozen for fine-tuning with a low learning rate.
- To diagnose training issues, temporarily removed data augmentation (rotation, zoom, etc.) from the training data generator, leaving only pixel rescaling.
- Increased the initial learning rate from 0.0001 to 0.001 to help the model escape a poor local minimum.
- Implemented separate `ModelCheckpoint` callbacks for the initial training and fine-tuning phases, saving to `best_plant_growth_stage.h5` and `best_plant_growth_stage_finetuned.h5` respectively. This resolves the `OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument` file access error during training.
- Corrected an `IndentationError` in the fine-tuning `model.fit()` call to fix a syntax error preventing script execution.

File: plant_app/views.py
Changes:
- Updated the model loaded from "plant_growth_stage.h5" to "plant_growth-stage.h5" to use the newly trained model.
- Corrected the model filename from "plant_growth-stage.h5" back to "plant_growth_stage.h5" to match the training script output and fix a FileNotFoundError.
- Added necessary imports (`requests`, `json`, `settings`, `base64`, `time`) for Nyckel API integration.
- Introduced a global variable `nyckel_access_token` to cache the Nyckel API access token.
- Implemented `_get_nyckel_access_token()` function to fetch and refresh the Nyckel access token using client ID and secret from `settings.py`.
- Implemented `_classify_image_with_nyckel(image_bytes)` function to send image data to the Nyckel API for classification and parse the response.
- Modified the `index` view to conditionally use the Nyckel API for image classification based on a `use_nyckel` form submission flag.
- Modified `_classify_image_with_nyckel` to construct a full data URI with the correct MIME type, fixing a `400 Bad Request` error from the Nyckel API.
- Modified `_classify_image_with_nyckel` function definition to make the `filename` parameter optional with a default value, to help diagnose `TypeError`.
- Added a debug print statement to `_classify_image_with_nyckel` to log the raw JSON response from the Nyckel API.
- Corrected the parsing logic in `_classify_image_with_nyckel` to handle the Nyckel API response as a dictionary, extracting `labelName` and `confidence` directly. Removed the debug print statement.
- Modified the `index` view to pass `stage` and `confidence` as separate variables to the template context.
- Modified the `index` view to initialize `error_message=None` and set `error_message` when classification fails (either local model or Nyckel API), passing it to the template context.

File: resize_dataset.py
Changes:
- Changed the padding color from white (255, 255, 255) to black (0, 0, 0) in the `resize_and_pad` function. This provides a more neutral background for pre-trained models.

File: plant_app/templates/index.html
Changes:
- Added a checkbox to allow users to select the Nyckel API as a backup classifier.
- Implemented a loading indicator (spinner and text) that appears when the "Detect Stage" button is clicked and disappears when the prediction is displayed. The button is also disabled during processing.
- Modified the prediction display to show the predicted stage and confidence separately, using a Bootstrap progress bar to visually represent the confidence score.
- Implemented a "No Prediction" state, displaying a friendly message ("Upload an image to get started!") when the page initially loads or if no prediction is available.
- Modified the prediction box to display a Bootstrap alert if an `error_message` is present in the context, prioritizing error messages over prediction results. Also changed the heading from "Predicted Stage" to "Prediction Result".
- Corrected the link to `style.css` in the HTML head from `{% static 'css/style.css' %}` to `{% static 'style.css' %}`.
- Removed inline styles from the `body` and `button` tags, moving them to `style.css` for better separation of concerns.
- Added `text-shadow` to the main `h2` title to improve its contrast and readability against the background image.
- Removed the `text-white` class from the "Detect Stage" button to allow the inline black color style to apply correctly.

File: plant_growth_stage/settings.py
Changes:
- Added Nyckel API configuration settings (`NYCKEL_CLIENT_ID`, `NYCKEL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `NYCKEL_INVOKE_URL`, `NYCKEL_TOKEN_URL`).

File: plant_app/static/style.css
Changes:
- Refactored `body` styles: integrated `linear-gradient` and `font-family` from inline HTML, preserved background image properties, and removed flexbox centering.
- Refactored `button` styles: integrated `background-color` and `border-radius` from inline HTML.
- Reverted `.container` background opacity, `h1, h2` color override, and `.navbar` background style to restore original aesthetics.
- Added a new `.main-title-color` class for custom color selection, applied to the `h2` main title, and set its color to brown (`rgb(68, 28, 11)`).
- Added `!important` to the `.main-title-color` class to ensure it overrides any conflicting styles.
